# Course Information
## Description
This course is a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of computer
communication networks including the design and implementation of the Internet, its protocols and appli-
cations. Topics to be covered include: layered network architectures, applications, network programming
interfaces (i.e., sockets), transport, congestion control, routing and data link protocols, local area networks,
and selected topics in mobile and wireless networking.
## Objectives
Our goal is for students to obtain a balanced understanding of all aspects of networking
through a combination of hands-on exploration and software development as well as textbook learning.
### Course learning outcomes
* describe the physical and logical organization of the internet;
* summarize the organization and functions of the layered internet protocol suite, including the application, transport, network, and link layers
* explain key networking concepts such as packet switching, packet forwarding and routing, congestion control, error detection, and reliable data transfer
* recall, summarize, and utilize major internet protocols at the application, transport, and network layers
* create network applications that use the socket API and/or software-defined-networking (SDN) APIs
* collect and inspect network packet traces to analyze the operation of network protocols
* explain key wireless networking concepts such as wireless link characteristics, wireless LANs, cellular
networks, and mobility management
